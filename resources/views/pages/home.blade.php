        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p>The UMKC Mock Trial Team is a student organization dedicated to competing in intercollegiate tournaments across the
            United States. In these competitions, student competitors put on imitation trials as either the prosecution
            or defense team. Competitors demonstrate their command of the court room by playing both the roles of witnesses
            and attorneys in a realistic trial setting.
